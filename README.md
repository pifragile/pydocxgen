# pydocxgen

pydocxgen is a Python package for creating docx files from templates. It supports Python 3.6 and greater.


## Code Style

pydocxgen uses the PEP8 styleguide.

## CI

pydocxgen runs both the [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linter as well as the unit tests in [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/pifragile).

## Pre-commit Hooks

If you want to locally run the flake8 linter as a pre-commit hook, run `pip3 install pre-commit` and then `pre-commit install` in your local repository.
